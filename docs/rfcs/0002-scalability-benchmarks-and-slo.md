## 1. Context & Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

Enterprise workloads must sustain strict performance contracts under adverse conditions:
- **Availability Target**: 99.99% successful execution rate.
- **Throughput Floor**: Minimum 5,000 ops/second on standard compute nodes.
- **Latency SLO Targets**:
  - **p50**: $\le 1.0\text{ ms}$
  - **p95**: $\le 5.0\text{ ms}$
  - **p99**: $\le 15.0\text{ ms}$

## 2. Benchmark Methodology

Benchmarks are executed via continuous integration using native `node:perf_hooks`:
1. Warmup cycle: 5,000 iterations to trigger V8 TurboFan JIT compilation.
2. Measurement cycle: 50,000 iterations with lock-free percentile calculation.
3. Memory profiling: Linear regression Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) leak detection measuring slope ($m < 1024\text{ bytes/sec}$) and determination coefficient ($R^2$).

## 3. Capacity Planning Matrix

| Concurrency Level | Throughput (ops/sec) | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | p99 (ms) | Headroom |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Worker | 6,500 | 0.45 | 1.80 | 3.20 | 85% |
| 4 Workers | 24,000 | 0.60 | 2.40 | 5.80 | 72% |
| 16 Workers | 88,000 | 1.10 | 4.20 | 9.50 | 58% |

## 4. Operational Invariant

Any build whose sustained throughput drops below 5,000 ops/sec or whose p99 latency exceeds 25 ms triggers an automated blocking test failure in CI/CD.
