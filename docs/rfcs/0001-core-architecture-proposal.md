## 1. Context & Problem Statement

Production systems require high concurrency, fault isolation, and deterministic execution without unbounded memory allocation or cascade failure propagation. Prior implementations relied on generic scaffolding that lacked strict mathematical guarantees and type-safe error boundaries.

## 2. Decision & Architectural Blueprint

We adopt a **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)** combined with:
1. **Railway-Oriented Programming (Result Monad)**: Every domain operation returns `Result<T, E>` without throwing untyped runtime exceptions.
2. **Branded Types**: Domain identifiers (`TenantIdentifier`, `CorrelationToken`) enforce structural validation at compile-time and runtime.
3. **Resilience Suite**: Sliding-window Circuit Breaker with Half-Open probe state, Token Bucket Rate Limiter with continuous proportional replenishment, and Full-Jitter Exponential Backoff.
4. **Zero-Allocation Telemetry**: Power-of-two circular ring buffers with single-cycle bitwise slot calculation (`cursor & (capacity - 1)`).

## 3. Invariants & Verification

- **Inbound Ports**: CLI Interface Gateway, HTTP/Webhook Capture Ingestion.
- **Outbound Ports**: Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Storage, Event Bus, Prometheus Exposition.
- **Verification**: 100% automated test coverage with deterministic fuzzing and memory leak regression analysis.

## 4. Consequences

- Eliminates runtime exception crashes across all critical transaction paths.
- Provides immediate observability via standard W3C TraceContext and Prometheus `/metrics`.
