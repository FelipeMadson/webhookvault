# Issue: Automated Self-Healing Health Probes

**State**: Closed (Implemented)  
**Author**: @platform-security  
**Date**: 2026-09-28  

### Request & Reproduction Scenario
Can we expose a comprehensive `doctor` CLI command to check cryptographic invariants, circuit breaker state, and rate limits in a single command?

```ts
// Steps to Reproduce
import { execSync } from "child_process";
execSync("npx @felipemadson/webhookvault doctor");
```

### Resolution by Felipe Madison (@FelipeMadson)
Implemented in `bin/cli.js doctor`. Returns a 4-point diagnostic probe checking value object invariants, timing-safe crypto, sliding window circuit breakers, and lock-free buffers.
