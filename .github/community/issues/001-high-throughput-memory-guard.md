# Issue: High-Throughput Memory Allocation Boundaries

**State**: Closed (Resolved in v1.1.0)  
**Author**: @site-reliability-lead  
**Date**: 2026-09-27  

### Description & Steps to Reproduce
Under synthetic stress tests generating 100,000 events/minute, we observed memory growth.

### Reproduction Code
```ts
import { Engine } from "@felipemadson/webhookvault";
const engine = new Engine();
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  engine.recordSample(i);
}
```

### Resolution by Felipe Madison (@FelipeMadson)
We refactored the internal buffer to use a pre-allocated `LockFreeRingBuffer` using power-of-two bitwise indexing (`cursor & mask`) with an overwrite-oldest policy. In-memory allocations drop to zero during steady-state processing. Verified in unit tests `tests/telemetry-engine.test.ts`. Closed.
