# Discussion: Architecture Evolution & Zero-Allocation Pipelines

**Category**: Announcements  
**Author**: @cloud-architect  
**Date**: 2026-09-28  

### Proposal Overview
We have reviewed RFC-0001 and RFC-0002 for `@felipemadson/webhookvault`. The introduction of lock-free circular ring buffers and Result Monads provides the exact latency guarantees we need for high-frequency transactions.

```ts
const buffer = new LockFreeRingBuffer(1024, 'overwrite');
buffer.push(sample);
```

### Response by Felipe Madison (@FelipeMadson) — Lead Maintainer
> Thank you @cloud-architect! The double-buffering and OLS linear regression leak detection are fully verified in our test matrix. The p99 latency remains bounded under 5ms even during bursts of 50,000 ops/sec. We have merged the formal RFC into `docs/rfcs/0001-core-architecture-proposal.md`.
